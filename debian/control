Description: Common code for working with images in ROS.
 .
 This stack contains the packages:
 * polled_camera: polled_camera contains a service and C++ helper classes for implementing a polled camera driver node and requesting images from it. The package is currently for internal use as the API is still under development.
 * camera_info_manager: This package provides a C++ interface for camera calibration information. It provides CameraInfo, and handles SetCameraInfo service requests, saving and restoring the camera calibration data.
 * image_transport: image_transport should always be used to subscribe to and publish images. It provides transparent support for transporting images in low-bandwidth compressed formats. Examples (provided by separate plugin packages) include JPEG/PNG compression and Theora streaming video.
 * camera_calibration_parsers: camera_calibration_parsers contains routines for reading and writing camera calibration parameters.
